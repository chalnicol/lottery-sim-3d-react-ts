# 3D Lottery Simulation

A **3D Lottery Draw Simulation** built with **Three.js, TypeScript, and GSAP**. This interactive hero section features bouncing lottery balls that are randomly drawn and displayed, with smooth physics and animations.

---

## Features

✅ **Realistic Ball Physics** – Balls bounce inside a container using Cannon.js (or Ammo.js).  
✅ **Random Lottery Draw** – 5 balls are drawn, animated into a display box, and then snapped outside.  
✅ **Exploding Effect** – Balls scatter before disappearing when drawn.  
✅ **GSAP Animations** – Used for button interactions and smooth effects.  
✅ **Orbit Controls** – Users can rotate the view horizontally.  
✅ **Modular Code** – Organized with separate classes for buttons, balls, and the container.  
✅ **React + TypeScript** – Fully typed for better maintainability.
